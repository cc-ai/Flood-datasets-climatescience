This folder contains the flood event archives recorded by Dartmouth Flood Observatory.

# Data

`FloodArchive.xlsx` : Recorded flood events since 1985-present with the information about Country, Coordination, Start and end date, number of suffered people, main cause, severity (return period), etc. Note that the coordination is just an estimate based on news and reports. Not super accurate, should be used only as a ballpark. Source: http://floodobservatory.colorado.edu/Archives/index.html

Shape files are also provided in the website and can be used at the frontend.



# Code

`flood-record.py` : Make an informative text based on the details in the dataset for the last flood event (if existed) in a given coordination.
